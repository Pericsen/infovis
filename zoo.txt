Time-Series Data;
stacked graph (stream graph);
Horizon Graph;
EDA, gaining insight into how data is distributed to inform data transformation and modeling decisions.; 
Q-Q Plots (quantile - quantile);
multivariate data; 
brushing-and-linking - a selection of points on one graph highlits the same points on all the other graphs; 
Parallel Coordinates (|| - coord);
Choropleth Maps;
Graduated Symbo Maps - avoids confounding geographic area with data values and allows for more dimensions to be visualized; 
Special visualization techniques exist to leverage hierarchical structure, allowing rapid multiscale inferences: micro-observations of individual elements and macro-observations of large groups;
Node-ling Diagrams;
Reingold-Tilford algorithm;
dendrogram (cluster) algorithm;
Adjacency Diagrams - a space-filling variant of the node-link diagram;
Enclosure Diagram - also space filling, using containment rather than adjacency to represent hierarchy.
Voronoi, jigsaw treemaps;
Relationship, a bridge between disparate groups;
force directed layou is a good starting point for understanding the structure of a general undirected graph;
seriation;
